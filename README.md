## üåü Project Overview

Welcome to the **Time Series Analysis** project! Time series data is everywhere, from stock prices to weather forecasts, and understanding its patterns can provide valuable insights. This project delves into the world of time series analysis, exploring various techniques to analyze, model, and forecast time-dependent data.

## üîç Features

- Data Preprocessing:
  - Handling missing values to ensure data completeness.
  - Normalizing and scaling data for consistent analysis.
  - Transforming data to improve stationarity.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
  - Visualizing time series data to identify trends, seasonality, and noise.
  - Decomposing time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
  - Conducting autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation analysis.

- Model Building: 
  - Implementing various time series forecasting models:
    - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): For linear modeling.
    - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA): To account for seasonality.
    - Prophet: A robust and easy-to-use forecasting tool by Facebook.
    - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A neural network approach for complex patterns.

- Model Evaluation: 
  - Using metrics such as:
    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): To measure average magnitude of errors.
    - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): To penalize larger errors.
    - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): To express accuracy as a percentage.
    - R-squared: To measure the goodness of fit.

- **Advanced Techniques:**
  - Implementing rolling statistics for dynamic analysis.
  - Using Fourier transforms for frequency domain analysis.
  - Employing machine learning algorithms for enhanced forecasting.

## üìä Dataset

This project uses a variety of time series datasets, including but not limited to:
